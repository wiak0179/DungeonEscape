ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------

this project is a dungeon exploration game with content that includes fighting monsters, purchasing supplies and equiptment,
gathering loot in the dungeon to sell, answering riddles, and defeating rooms. I have followed the design in the write up
with only a few changes to lower the difficulty slightly. Happy dungeoning!
